Latent Adversarial Regularization for Offline Preference Optimization (https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22083)

GANPO is a plug-and-play latent-space regularization framework for offline preference optimization (OPO) in large language models. It introduces adversarial divergence estimation in representation space, providing dense structural feedback beyond token-level constraints.
